			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Set up monorepo foundation with pnpm workspaces",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down monorepo setup into: root package.json configuration, pnpm-workspace.yaml creation, TypeScript base config setup, .gitignore and environment files, and Node.js version management with .nvmrc",
			"reasoning": "Foundation task requiring careful workspace configuration, TypeScript setup, and environment management. Moderate complexity due to multiple configuration files and Cloudflare Workers compatibility requirements."

			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Create shared config package for TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: package.json setup for @agentset-cf/config, TypeScript configuration files (base and strict), ESLint configuration with Cloudflare Workers rules, and Prettier configuration with consistent formatting",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity requiring knowledge of modern tooling configurations, TypeScript 5.3+ features, and Cloudflare Workers-specific requirements. Multiple interdependent configuration files need coordination."

			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Cloudflare Worker with routing and middleware",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: Hono framework setup and routing configuration, CORS middleware implementation, authentication middleware, error handling middleware, health check endpoint, and Worker configuration with wrangler.toml",
			"reasoning": "Moderate-high complexity involving modern Worker patterns, Hono v4+ framework, middleware composition, and proper TypeScript integration. Requires understanding of Cloudflare Workers environment and HTTP handling."

			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate AI Search service for semantic retrieval",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: AI Search API client implementation, search function with filtering and tenant isolation, retry logic with exponential backoff, response parsing and processing, and TypeScript interface definitions",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to AI Search API integration, tenant isolation logic, retry mechanisms, and proper error handling. Requires understanding of AI Search v1 API and metadata filtering patterns."

			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: Gateway API client with headers, model route configuration, provider fallback chain implementation, Workers AI fallback, request/response transformation, and streaming support preparation",
			"reasoning": "High complexity involving AI Gateway headers, multi-provider fallback logic, OpenAI-compatible transformations, and Workers AI integration. Complex header management and fallback chains increase difficulty."

		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Build search request handler with context assembly",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: request validation with Zod, search parameter processing, AI Search orchestration, context assembly with citations, and response formatting with error handling",
			"reasoning": "High complexity as the main orchestration endpoint bringing together AI Search and AI Gateway. Requires careful context assembly, citation formatting, and comprehensive error handling across multiple services."

			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Create agentset-tools package for UI integration",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: package.json and TypeScript interfaces setup, HTTP client implementation with retry logic, comprehensive JSDoc documentation, and error handling with typed exceptions",
